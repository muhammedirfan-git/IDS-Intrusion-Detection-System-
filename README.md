# IDS-Intrusion-Detection-System-
This is a series of intrusion detection system which helps in Industrial Control Process.

a) Ensemble model :-
            This project focuses on developing and optimizing ensemble learning models using various techniques like Random Search, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grid Search, and     
             Bayesian Optimization. The ensembler aims to improve the predictive performance by combining different models.

Features
Random Search: Automated hyperparameter tuning through random search.
Genetic Algorithm Method (GA): Optimization using genetic algorithms.
Grid Search: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
F1 Scores of the Ensemblers: Evaluation of ensemble models using F1 scores.
Bayesian Optimization: Probabilistic model optimization.


b)Rule-Based Intrusion Detection System
Overview
This project involves the development of a rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS) focused on analyzing specific time segments of data to detect anomalies or attacks.

Features
100-200 seconds: Analysis of data from the 100-200 second mark.
100-400 seconds: Broader analysis covering 100-400 seconds.
100-600 seconds: Extended analysis over 100-600 seconds.
Last 600 seconds: Examination of the last 600 seconds of data.
Random 600 seconds: Randomized data sampling for intrusion detection.



c)Spontaneous Events Analyzer
This Python script analyzes spontaneous events in network traffic for industrial control system protocols, specifically DNP3, IEC 104, and GOOSE.
Features
Parses PCAP files to extract relevant protocol information
Identifies spontaneous events in DNP3, IEC 104, and GOOSE protocols
Generates visualizations for event analysis:
Bar plots of spontaneous events over time
Inter-arrival time plots
Autocorrelation plots
Frequency spectrum analysis
